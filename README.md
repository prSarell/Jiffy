# Jiffy

Jiffy is an executive function assistant web app designed to help users manage categories for tasks and activities. It allows users to add and delete categories, with persistence using localStorage and dynamic colors for visual distinction.

## Features
- Add and delete categories with a simple UI.
- Persistent storage using localStorage.
- Dynamic colors for categories.
- Select mode for managing categories.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or serve it using a local server (e.g., `live-server`).
3. Ensure all assets (e.g., `prompts.png`, `rewards.png`, `add.png`) are in the `assets/` directory.

## Future Development
- Add prompts and rewards features.
- Implement user-editable colors for categories.
